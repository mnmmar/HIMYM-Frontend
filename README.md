# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To redeploy from Netlify, in the terminal run
```
npm run build

sudo netlify deploy --prod
```

Approach Taken

We decided to make a small wiki page of the How I Met Your Mother show, a classic fan favorite. The search for an existing 3rd party API was long and hard but we managed to find one that had all the episodes and cast members, as well as the roles each played. We knew that we wanted a page for episodes and cast for sure and then expanded onto adding a blog like forum with comments since we didn't want the cast list or episode list to be editted or deleted. 

Technologies Used

* React
* PSQL
* Heroku
* Netlify
* Python
* Material UI

Unsolved Problems

We ended up not having time for authentification, which was one of our original stretch goals. After we added the blog, we decided we didn't have enough time for it since it was going to take us over the span of multiple days in order to add user login and tie it to each blog post so that only that certain user could edit and/or delete it.
